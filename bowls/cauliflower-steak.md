# Cauliflower Steak on Hummus, with Cilantro-Mint Chutney, and Pitas

## Ingredients
### For Cauliflower Steaks:
- 1 large head of cauliflower
- 1/4 cup olive oil
- 3 tsp smoked paprika
- 3 tsp ground cumin
- 2 tsp ground coriander
- 1 tsp turmeric
- 3 tbsp lemon juice
- Salt and pepper, to taste

### For Serving:
- 2 cups hummus (separate recipe)
- 1/4 cup cilantro-mint chutney (separate recipe)
- 2–3 pitas, warmed
- Optional garnish: Fresh cilantro leaves, pomegranate seeds, or toasted pine nuts

## Instructions
### Prep Cauliflower Steaks:
1. Remove the leaves and trim the stem of the cauliflower, keeping the core intact.
2. Slice the cauliflower into 3/4-inch thick "steaks." Reserve any small florets for another use. A small head may only yield 2 steaks, while a larger one may yield 3.

### Marinate Cauliflower:
3. In a small bowl, whisk together olive oil, smoked paprika, cumin, coriander, turmeric, lemon juice, salt, and pepper.
4. Brush the marinade generously onto both sides of each cauliflower steak.
5. Let the cauliflower rest for 10 minutes to absorb the flavors.

### Cook Cauliflower Steaks:
6. Preheat the oven to 450°F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Place the cauliflower steaks on the sheet and roast for 15 minutes. Flip the steaks, then roast for another 5–10 minutes until golden brown and tender.

### Assemble and Serve:
7. Spread a generous layer of hummus on each plate.
8. Place a cauliflower steak on top of the hummus.
9. Drizzle with cilantro-mint chutney.
10. Serve with warmed pita on the side. Garnish with fresh cilantro, pomegranate seeds, or pine nuts, if desired.
