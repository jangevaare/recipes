- 1 medium sweet potato, peeled and cubed  
- 2 cans brown lentils, drained  
- 2 tbsp olive oil  
- Salt & pepper to taste  

### **Chili-Onion Jam**  
- ¼ cup vegetable oil  
- 1 large onion, finely chopped  
- 1 tbsp gochujang  
- 1 tbsp honey  
- 1 tbsp soy sauce  
- 1 tbsp rice vinegar  
- 2 cloves garlic, minced  
- 1 tsp grated ginger  
- ¼ cup water  

### **Fried Brussels Sprouts**  
- 450g Brussels sprouts, halved or quartered  
- Vegetable oil (for frying)  

### **Bowl Assembly & Toppings**  
- 6 oz halloumi, sliced  
- ¼ cup quick-pickled carrots (matchstick-sized)  
- 2 tbsp toasted pumpkin seeds  

## Instructions  

### **1. Cook Brown Rice**  
1. Rinse the brown rice under cold water until the water runs clear.  
2. In a medium saucepan, bring 2 cups water to a boil. Add the rice and salt, reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer for **35–40 minutes**, or until tender and water is absorbed.  
3. Remove from heat and let rest, covered, for 10 minutes. Fluff with a fork before serving.  

### **2. Roast Sweet Potatoes & Lentils**  
1. Preheat oven to 400°F (200°C).  
2. Toss cubed sweet potato with 1 tbsp olive oil, salt, and pepper. Spread on one side of a parchment-lined baking sheet.  
3. Toss lentils with remaining 1 tbsp olive oil, salt, and pepper. Spread on the other side of the same sheet (or use a separate one).  
4. Roast for **25–30 minutes**, stirring halfway, until sweet potatoes are tender and lentils are crispy.  

### **3. Make Chili-Onion Jam**  
1. Heat vegetable oil in a small pan over medium-low heat. Sauté chopped onion until deeply golden brown.  
2. Deglaze with water, allowing it to evaporate for richer flavor and softer texture.  
3. Stir in gochujang, honey, soy sauce, rice vinegar, garlic, and ginger. Simmer briefly until thickened.  

### **4. Fry Brussels Sprouts**  
1. Heat vegetable oil in a deep pan or fryer to **350°F (175°C)**.  
2. Fry Brussels sprouts in batches until crispy and browned. Remove and drain on paper towels.  
3. Toss fried Brussels sprouts in the chili-onion jam until well coated.  

### **5. Prepare Toppings & Assemble Bowl**  
1. Pan-fry halloumi in a dry skillet over medium heat until golden on both sides.  
2. Assemble the bowl with cooked brown rice, roasted sweet potato, crispy lentils, and fried Brussels sprouts.  
3. Top with pan-fried halloumi, pickled carrots, and toasted pumpkin seeds. Serve immediately.
