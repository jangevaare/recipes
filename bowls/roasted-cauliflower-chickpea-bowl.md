## Instructions  

1. **Preheat oven** to 425°F (218°C).  
2. **Cook the Rice:** In a medium pot, bring water, spices, and salt to a boil. Rinse and drain rice, then add it to the pot. Cover and simmer (white basmati: ~20 min, brown basmati: ~40 min).  
3. **Prepare the Veggies:** On a parchment-lined sheet pan, toss cauliflower, onion, and chickpeas with olive oil. Mix the spice blend in a small bowl and sprinkle over the veggies, tossing to coat evenly.  
4. **Roast:** Bake for 20–25 minutes. Check, toss, and cook for another 5 minutes if needed.  
5. **Make the Yogurt Sauce:** In a bowl, mix all sauce ingredients. Add a splash of water or olive oil if a thinner consistency is desired.  
6. **Assemble the Bowls:** Divide rice among bowls. Add a handful of baby spinach, then top with roasted cauliflower, onions, and chickpeas. Drizzle with yogurt sauce, then garnish with pomegranate seeds and toasted almonds.
