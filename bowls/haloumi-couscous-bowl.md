### Prepare the Roasted Peppers
1. Preheat oven to 220°C (430°F). Cut peppers into large quarters, remove seeds, and place skin-side up on a baking tray.
2. Drizzle with olive oil and sprinkle with salt. Roast for 20-25 minutes, until the skins are charred.

1. Heat olive oil in a large saucepan over medium heat.
2. Add garlic and cook for 20 seconds until fragrant.
3. Stir in couscous and lightly toast for 1 minute.
4. Add vegetable stock and salt. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to medium and simmer uncovered for 10 minutes or until liquid is absorbed.
5. Transfer to a large bowl, fluff with a fork, and let cool.

### Cook the Haloumi
1. Heat olive oil in a large non-stick frying pan over medium-high heat.
