## Instructions
1. **Candy the walnuts** (5 min active).  
   Heat sugar & water in a small skillet to a rapid simmer; add walnuts, toss until syrupy, ~2 min. Scatter on parchment, sprinkle salt, let harden. (Can make days ahead.)

2. **Crisp the quinoa** (20–25 min, mostly hands-off).  
   Simmer quinoa in salted water until tails show (~15 min); drain if soupy. Spread on a rimmed sheet, drizzle with oil, dust with paprika (+ cayenne). Bake 20–25 min @ 325 °F, stirring once, until dry and crackly; cool.

3. **Prep the rest while quinoa bakes.**  
   Segment oranges; slice onion; chop spinach, mint, and candied walnuts.  
   If using halloumi, sear cubes in a thin slick of hot oil over medium until golden on most sides (4–5 min); drain.

4. **Assemble & serve.**  
   Whisk Maple-Mustard Vinaigrette in a large bowl. Add spinach, chickpeas, onion, mint, oranges (plus juice), walnuts, cooled crispy quinoa, and halloumi (if using). Toss gently, taste for salt/pepper, and serve immediately so quinoa stays crunchy.  

   *Meal-prep:* store dressing & quinoa separately; combine just before eating.
