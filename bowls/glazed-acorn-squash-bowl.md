- ½ tsp smoked paprika
- Salt

### Halloumi

## Instructions

1. **Prep (before heat):**  
   Halve acorn squash, scoop seeds, cut into 2–2.5 cm wedges. Mix glaze ingredients. Drain lentils and dry thoroughly (towel + air-dry a few minutes).

2. **Roast squash:**  
   Heat oven to 220°C. Toss squash with olive oil and salt. Roast cut-side down on a hot tray until deeply caramelized underneath and tender through, 25–30 min (edges browned, flesh easily pierced). Flip, brush with glaze, return to oven 5–8 min until glossy and aromatic (glaze should cling, not pool).

3. **Roast lentils (parallel):**  
   Toss lentils with olive oil, cumin, smoked paprika, and salt. Spread thinly on a second tray. Roast until dry, blistered, and crunchy, 25–30 min, shaking once. Doneness cue: lentils feel dry and crisp, not chewy.

4. **Fry halloumi:**  
   Heat a wide skillet over medium-high with a thin oil film. Fry halloumi until deeply golden on both sides, 2–3 min per side. Remove to paper towel; optional light squeeze of lemon.

5. **Dress greens:**  
   Whisk dressing. Toss lettuces lightly—just coated, still fluffy and dry-feeling.

6. **Assemble:**  
   Spread dressed greens on a wide platter. Layer squash wedges, halloumi, and crispy lentils. Finish with herbs, seeds (if using), and a final squeeze of lemon or a few drops of chili oil.

7. **To serve:**  
   Serve immediately while squash and halloumi are warm and lentils stay crisp.

8. **Storage:**  
   Store components separately. Reheat squash gently; recrisp lentils in a hot oven or pan. Assemble fresh.
