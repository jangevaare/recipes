## Instructions
1. **Prep (before heat):**  
   - Whisk all glaze ingredients; reserve 1/3 cup separately for finishing bowls.  
   - Toss chosen protein with remaining glaze; marinate 10–20 min (salmon), 20–30 min (chicken), or 30 min (tofu).  
   - Smash cucumber lightly, tear into chunks; toss with vinegar, sesame oil, and salt.  
   - Mandolin carrots; toss with vinegar, sugar, and salt until lightly softened.

2. **Cook protein:**  
   - Heat a wide skillet over medium-high with a thin film of neutral oil.  
   - **Salmon:** Sear in a single layer until deeply golden on one side and releases easily, 2–3 min; flip and cook 1–2 min more.  
   - **Chicken:** Sear until browned and cooked through, turning once; glaze should reduce and turn glossy, 5–7 min total.  
   - **Tofu:** Sear undisturbed until crisped edges form and surfaces are deeply golden, 4–5 min per side.

3. **Glaze & finish:**  
   - Lower heat to medium-low. Add any remaining marinade to the pan; simmer until thick, shiny, and clinging, 1–2 min.  
   - Kill heat once the glaze coats aggressively but before it tightens into candy.

4. **To serve:**  
   - Spoon rice into bowls. Drizzle rice with reserved glaze for light sauciness.  
   - Top with protein, smashed cucumber, dressed carrots, and avocado.  
   - Finish with sesame seeds, lime juice, and chili crisp or sriracha mayo if using.

5. **Storage/freezing:**  
   - Protein and rice keep 3–4 days refrigerated. Reheat gently; add a splash of water to loosen glaze.  
   - Do not freeze cucumber or carrots; freeze protein only.
