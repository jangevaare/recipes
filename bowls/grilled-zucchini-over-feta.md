# Grilled Hot-Honey-Butter Zucchini “Steaks” over Whipped Feta  

## Ingredients  
### Zucchini  
- 3 medium zucchini, ends trimmed, halved lengthwise, then cut lengthwise again into ½-inch “steaks”
- Neutral oil, for brushing  
- Flaky salt & cracked black pepper  

### Hot-Honey Butter Glaze  
- 2 Tbsp unsalted butter  
- 1 ½ Tbsp hot honey*  
- 1 small garlic clove, smashed  
- 1 tsp white miso (optional)  
- Pinch Aleppo/red-pepper flakes (more heat, optional)  

\*DIY: warm 1 Tbsp honey + ½ tsp chili flakes 30 s.

### Whipped Feta Base  
- 6 oz (170 g) feta, drained  
- ½ cup (120 g) thick Greek yogurt or labneh  
- 2 Tbsp extra-virgin olive oil  
- Zest of ½ lemon + 1 tsp juice  
- 1 Tbsp chopped dill or mint  
- Black pepper  

### Finish  
- 2 Tbsp toasted pine nuts or pistachios  
- Extra hot honey for drizzling  
- More herbs & lemon zest, to taste  

## Instructions  
1. **Whip the feta (make-ahead, 2 min).** Blitz feta, yogurt, olive oil, lemon zest/juice, herbs, and pepper until silky; chill.  

2. **Prep zucchini (while grill heats).** Lightly brush planks with oil; season with salt and pepper.  

3. **Grill (≈ 5 min).** On a hot, clean grate (direct high heat), lay zucchini cut-side-down. Grill until deep char appears, about 3 min; flip and char the second side 1–2 min. Transfer to a platter.  

4. **Glaze (1 min).** In a small skillet on a side burner or directly on the grate, melt butter with garlic. Whisk in hot honey, miso, and flakes just until bubbling, then slide in grilled zucchini; turn to coat. Pull off heat when glossy.  

5. **Plate & finish.** Swirl whipped feta onto a warm platter, pile zucchini steaks on top, spooning every drop of glaze. Shower with nuts, herbs, lemon zest, and a last thread of hot honey.  

Total active time: ≈ 15 minutes. Serves 2 (main with bread) or 4 (side).
