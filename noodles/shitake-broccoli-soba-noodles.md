# Soba Noodles With Tofu, Shiitake Mushrooms, and Broccoli

## Ingredients
### Vegetables and Tofu
- 1 pound broccoli, crowns broken into small florets, stems peeled and diced
- 2 tablespoons canola oil (divided)
- 6 ounces shiitake mushrooms, stems removed, caps quartered
- 2 garlic cloves, minced
- 2 teaspoons fresh ginger, minced
- 6 scallions (white and light green parts only), sliced
- 1/2 teaspoon red-pepper flakes
- 1 pound firm tofu, sliced and drained on paper towels

### Sauce
- 1 cup vegetable stock
- 2 tablespoons soy sauce (plus more to taste)

### Noodles
- 1/2 pound soba or udon noodles, or dried rice sticks (soak rice sticks in hot water for 20 minutes)

### Garnish
- 1/2 cup chopped cilantro
- 2 teaspoons sesame oil

## Instructions
### Prepare Ingredients
1. **Blanch Broccoli**: Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the broccoli and blanch for 1 minute. Transfer to a bowl of ice water to cool, then drain and dry on paper towels. Keep the pot of water hot for cooking noodles later.

### Cook Vegetables and Tofu
2. **Cook Mushrooms**: Heat 1 tablespoon of oil in a wide skillet or wok over medium-high heat until rippling. Add mushrooms and sear for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally. Reduce heat to medium and add garlic, ginger, scallions, and red-pepper flakes. Cook for 30 seconds to 1 minute, until fragrant. Transfer to a bowl.
3. **Sear Tofu**: Heat remaining oil in the same skillet over medium-high heat. Add tofu and sear for about 1 minute per side, until lightly golden. Add 1 teaspoon soy sauce and toss to coat.
4. **Combine Ingredients**: Return mushroom mixture and broccoli to the pan with tofu. Add stock and soy sauce. Bring to a simmer, then reduce heat to low. Simmer uncovered for 1-2 minutes, until broccoli is crisp-tender. Remove from heat.

### Cook and Combine Noodles
5. **Cook Noodles**: Bring the pot of water back to a boil. Cook soba or udon noodles until al dente (about 5 minutes) or softened rice noodles for 1 minute. Drain well.
6. **Toss Together**: Add cooked noodles to the skillet with the vegetables and tofu. Toss to combine and heat through. Stir in cilantro and sesame oil.

### Serve
7. **Plate and Enjoy**: Serve hot, adjusting soy sauce to taste if needed.
