# Miso Mushroom Bucatini

## Ingredients

### Pasta
- 7 ounces dried bucatini
- Salt (for pasta water)

### Mushrooms
- 4 ounces mixed mushrooms (e.g., shimeji, eryngii, oyster), chopped or torn into bite-sized pieces
- 2 tablespoons vegetable oil (divided)
- 1 teaspoon sherry vinegar or white wine vinegar

### Sauce
- 2 teaspoons red miso paste
- 3 tablespoons softened butter
- 5 garlic cloves, minced
- 1/2 cup heavy cream

### Garnish
- 1 scallion, finely sliced
- Salt and freshly cracked black pepper, to taste

## Instructions
### Preparation
1. Bring a large pot of salted water to a rolling boil and cook pasta until just under al dente (1 minute less than package instructions). Drain and set aside.
2. Chop or pull apart mushrooms into large, bite-sized pieces.

### Cooking
1. Heat a large skillet over high heat with 1 tbsp vegetable oil. Sauté mushrooms in 2–3 batches for 3–5 minutes until browned. Deglaze each batch with a splash of sherry vinegar, toss, and set aside.
2. In a small bowl, whisk miso paste and softened butter until smooth and fluffy.
3. In a medium saucepan, heat the remaining 1 tbsp vegetable oil over medium heat. Sauté minced garlic for 30 seconds to 1 minute until fragrant.
4. Add sautéed mushrooms, miso-butter mixture, and heavy cream to the saucepan. Stir and bring to a boil.

### Combine and Serve
1. Add cooked pasta to the sauce. Stir until pasta is well-coated and cook for 1–2 minutes until al dente. Adjust seasoning with salt, if needed.
2. Divide into bowls, garnish with sliced scallions and freshly cracked black pepper. Serve immediately.
