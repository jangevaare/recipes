## Instructions

1. **Prepare the Soup Base:**
   - In a large, heavy-bottomed pot, heat 1/4 cup olive oil over medium heat.
   - Add diced onions, carrots, and celery. Saut√© until vegetables are softened, about 10 minutes.
   - Stir in minced garlic, red pepper flakes, chopped rosemary, and bay leaves. Cook for an additional 2 minutes until fragrant.

2. **Add Tomatoes and Broth:**
   - Pour in the diced tomatoes with their juice. Stir to combine.
   - Add the vegetable broth
   - Stir in white kidney beans
   - Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce heat to low and let the soup simmer, uncovered, for about 20 minutes.

4. **Add Kale and Bread:**
   - Add the chopped lacinato kale to the pot.
   - Stir in the torn pieces of day-old bread.
   - Continue to simmer for another 10-15 minutes, allowing the bread to break down and thicken the soup slightly.

5. **Prepare the Lemon Rosemary Garlic Oil:**
   - While the soup is simmering, prepare the finishing oil.
   - In a small saucepan over low heat, combine 1/2 cup olive oil, minced garlic, and chopped rosemary.
   - Gently warm the mixture until the garlic is fragrant, about 5 minutes.
   - Remove from heat and stir in the lemon zest. Set aside.

6. **Season and Serve:**
   - Remove the bay leaves and Parmesan rinds from the soup.
   - Season the soup with salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste.
   - Ladle the ribollita into bowls and drizzle each serving with the lemon rosemary garlic oil.
   - Serve hot, accompanied by additional crusty bread if desired.

*Note:* This soup often tastes even better the next day as the flavors meld and deepen. It's traditionally reheated and enjoyed over several days.
