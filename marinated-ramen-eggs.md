- 1.5 teaspoons garlic chili paste (adjust to taste)

## Instructions

### 1. Boil the Eggs
- Gently place the cold eggs into boiling water.
- Boil for 8–9 minutes for a jammy yolk, maintaining a gentle boil to avoid cracking.

### 2. Prepare Ice Bath

### 3. Cool the Eggs
- Transfer boiled eggs to the ice bath with a slotted spoon.
- Let them cool for 5–10 minutes.

### 4. Peel the Eggs
- Peel the eggs under running water or in the ice bath to remove shell fragments.

### 6. Marinate the Eggs
- Submerge peeled eggs fully in the marinade.
- Refrigerate for at least 2 hours, preferably overnight, for deeper flavor.

### 7. Store
- Keep marinated eggs in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to one week.

*Note:* Adjust chili paste for your spice tolerance. Handle eggs gently to avoid cracks during boiling.
