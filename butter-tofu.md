# Butter Tofu (Tofu Makhani)

## Ingredients

### Tofu Marinade
- 2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice
- 1 tablespoon ground cumin
- 1 heaping tablespoon ground turmeric
- 2 (14-ounce) packages firm tofu

### Sauce
- 8 tablespoons ghee or unsalted butter (1 stick)
- 2 yellow onions, peeled and diced
- 1 teaspoon ground chile powder (e.g., cayenne)
- 3 tablespoons peeled and minced fresh ginger
- 4 garlic cloves, minced
- 1 (28-ounce) can whole peeled tomatoes
- 1 cinnamon stick
- 1 teaspoon paprika
- 1 teaspoon ground turmeric
- 1½ teaspoons fine sea salt
- 1½ cups heavy cream or full-fat coconut milk

### Garnish & Serving
- 3 scallions, thinly sliced on the bias
- ¼ cup cilantro leaves and tender stems
- Naan, basmati rice, yogurt, and quartered cucumbers, for serving

## Instructions

### Prepare the Tofu
1. In a large bowl, whisk lemon juice, cumin, and 1 heaping tablespoon turmeric with 1 tablespoon water to form a thin paste.
2. Drain and pat tofu dry, then cut into 1-inch cubes. Add tofu to the marinade, stirring gently to coat. Set aside at room temperature or refrigerate for up to 1 day.

### Cook the Sauce
3. In a large pot over medium heat, melt butter. Add onions and chile powder, cooking until translucent, about 5 minutes.
4. Reduce heat, add ginger and garlic, and cook until onions are lightly browned, about 5 minutes.
5. Add tomatoes and their juices, crushing them by hand as you go. Stir in the cinnamon stick, paprika, sea salt, and remaining 1 teaspoon turmeric. Cook until the mixture resembles a thick ragù, about 10 minutes.
6. Blend the sauce using an immersion blender (or transfer to a blender and purée), then return to the pot.

### Combine & Simmer
7. Stir in cream and marinated tofu with its marinade. Simmer over low heat, uncovered, until tofu absorbs the sauce's color and flavor, about 5 minutes. Stir occasionally but gently to avoid breaking the tofu.

### Garnish & Serve
8. Transfer tofu and sauce to a serving dish. Sprinkle with scallions and cilantro.
9. Serve with warm naan, basmati rice, yogurt, and cucumbers.
