## Instructions
1. **Prep (before heat):** Dice leek; slice carrots; mince 2 garlic cloves; grate 1 garlic clove to a paste; chunk stewing mushrooms; peel pearl onions; tear maitake into fronds; rinse lentils well; measure wine/broth/tamari.
2. **Brown mushrooms + onions (2 batches):** Heat a large Dutch oven over medium-high with 1 Tbsp fat. Add half the stewing mushrooms + half the pearl onions in a single layer. Leave undisturbed until mushrooms are deeply browned on the bottom and edges look crisp; stir and brown again until most surfaces have color and the pot smells toasty, 5–7 min total. Season with salt/pepper, transfer out. Repeat with 1 Tbsp fat and remaining mushrooms/onions.
3. **Build the base:** Lower to medium. Add 1 Tbsp fat. Cook leeks + carrots with a pinch of salt until leeks are soft and lightly golden and the pot looks less wet, ~5 min. Add minced garlic; cook just until fragrant, ~30 sec. Stir in tomato paste; cook until it darkens slightly and smells sweet, ~1 min. Sprinkle in flour; stir until it coats everything and turns a bit blonde, ~1 min.
4. **Simmer with lentils:** Add wine, scraping up browned bits. Add 2 cups (480 ml) vegetable broth, 1 Tbsp tamari, thyme, bay leaf, and the rinsed lentils. Return browned mushrooms/onions. Bring to a gentle simmer, then cover ajar and cook low until lentils are tender but still hold shape, carrots are tender, and the sauce is glossy and lightly thickened (coats a spoon), 30–45 min. If it tightens too much before lentils are done, add a splash of broth (60–120 ml).
5. **Finish seasoning:** Taste and adjust with more tamari (usually +1–2 tsp) and/or salt. Off heat, stir in the grated garlic paste.
6. **Crispy maitake (right before serving):** Heat a skillet over high heat. Add just enough fat to film the pan. Add maitake in a single layer and press lightly so fronds contact the pan. Cook undisturbed until deeply browned and crisp at the edges; flip/toss and crisp the other side. Season with salt and a pinch of smoked paprika. (Do in 2 batches if needed—crowding steams.)
7. **To serve:** Spoon over mashed potatoes, making a shallow well so sauce pools. Top with crispy maitake, parsley, and a final dusting of smoked paprika (skip if rushed).
8. **Storage/freezing:** Keeps 4 days refrigerated. Reheat gently on the stove with a splash of broth until loose
