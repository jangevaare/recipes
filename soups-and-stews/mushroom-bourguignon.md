- 3 fresh thyme sprigs (or ½ tsp dried thyme)

## Instructions
1. **Prep (before heat):** Dice leek; slice carrots; mince 2 garlic cloves; grate 1 garlic clove to a paste; chunk stewing mushrooms; peel pearl onions; tear maitake into fronds; measure wine/broth/tamari; tie thyme (optional).
2. **Brown mushrooms + onions (2 batches):** Heat a large Dutch oven over medium-high with 1 Tbsp fat. Add half the stewing mushrooms + half the pearl onions in a single layer. Leave undisturbed until mushrooms are deeply browned on the bottom and edges look a bit crisp; stir and brown again until most surfaces have color and the pan smells toasty, 5–7 min total. Season with salt/pepper, transfer out. Repeat with 1 Tbsp fat and remaining mushrooms/onions.
3. **Build the base:** Lower to medium. Add 1 Tbsp fat. Cook leeks + carrots with a pinch of salt until leeks are soft and lightly golden and the pan looks less wet, ~5 min. Add minced garlic; cook just until fragrant, ~30 sec. Stir in tomato paste; cook until it darkens slightly and smells sweet, ~1 min. Sprinkle in flour; stir until it coats everything and turns a bit blonde, ~1 min.
4. **Simmer to glossy:** Add wine, scraping up browned bits. Add broth, tamari, thyme, and bay leaf. Return browned mushrooms/onions. Bring to a gentle simmer, then cover ajar and cook low until carrots are tender and the sauce is glossy and lightly thickened (it should coat a spoon, not look watery), 30–40 min. Taste and adjust salt/tamari. Off heat, stir in the grated garlic paste.
5. **Crispy maitake (right before serving):** Heat a skillet over high heat. Add just enough fat to film the pan. Add maitake in a single layer and press lightly so fronds contact the pan. Cook undisturbed until deeply browned and crisp at the edges; flip/toss and crisp the other side. Season with salt and a pinch of smoked paprika. (Do in 2 batches if needed—crowding steams.)
6. **To serve:** Spoon bourguignon over mashed potatoes, making a shallow well so sauce pools. Top with crispy maitake, parsley, and a final dusting of smoked paprika (skip if rushed).
7. **Storage/freezing:** Keeps 4 days refrigerated. Reheat gently on the stove with a splash of broth/water until loose and glossy. Freeze bourguignon up to 3 months (best without parsley/maitake); make crispy maitake fresh after reheating.
