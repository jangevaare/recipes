# Andalusian Soup

## Ingredients
- 3 medium onions, diced
- 1 bunch celery, diced
- 2 cans (15 oz each) chickpeas, drained and rinsed
- 6 tablespoons (¾ stick) butter
- 1 cup dry white wine
- 3 cans (28 oz each) diced tomatoes
- 4 cups vegetable broth
- 2–3 bay leaves
- Freshly ground black pepper, to taste
- 1½ cups heavy cream (room temperature)
- ¼ cup fresh basil, chopped
- ¼ cup flat-leaf parsley, chopped
- Salt, to taste

## Instructions
1. Melt butter in a large pot or Dutch oven over medium heat; sauté onions and celery until lightly caramelized, about 8–10 minutes. Add chickpeas; cook for another 2–3 minutes.
2. Deglaze the pot with white wine, scraping up browned bits from the bottom; simmer briefly until slightly reduced.
3. Add tomatoes (with juices), vegetable broth, bay leaves, and black pepper; bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer gently 15–20 minutes.
4. Remove bay leaves. Temper heavy cream with a little hot soup, then slowly stir tempered cream into the soup off the heat to prevent curdling. Add fresh basil and parsley; warm gently without boiling.
