# Spicy Peanut Stew with Sweet Potato and Kale

## Ingredients

### Base Ingredients
- 4 tbsp olive oil
- 1 onion, diced
- 2 jalapeños, minced
- 4 cloves garlic, minced
- 6 large sweet potatoes, peeled and cubed
- 1 (28-ounce) can diced tomatoes
- 2 (14-ounce) cans light coconut milk
- 4 cups water

### Spices and Flavorings
- 2 tsp salt
- 2 tsp curry powder or turmeric
- 1 tsp ground cumin
- 1 tsp paprika
- 1/2–1 tsp chili powder (adjust to taste)

### Toppings and Enhancements
- 1 cup chopped peanuts
- 1/2 cup peanut butter
- 2–4 cups kale, stems removed, chopped
- Fresh cilantro, chopped (optional)
- Lime wedges, for serving

## Instructions

### Preparation
1. Prepare and measure all ingredients: dice the onion, mince the jalapeños and garlic, peel and cube the sweet potatoes, and chop the kale.
2. Open and measure liquids (coconut milk, tomatoes, water) and set aside spices for easy access.

### Cooking
1. Heat olive oil in a large soup pot over medium heat. Add the onion, garlic, and jalapeños, sautéing until soft and fragrant (3–5 minutes).
2. Stir in the sweet potatoes and cook for an additional 5 minutes, allowing them to lightly brown and absorb the flavors of the aromatics.
3. Add the tomatoes, coconut milk, water, salt, curry powder (or turmeric), cumin, paprika, chili powder, and half of the chopped peanuts. Stir well and bring to a simmer.
4. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until the sweet potatoes are fork-tender, about 20–25 minutes.
5. Stir in the peanut butter and chopped kale. Simmer for another 5–10 minutes until the kale is wilted and the soup is thick and creamy.

### Serving
1. Ladle the soup into bowls and top with the remaining chopped peanuts and fresh cilantro, if desired.
2. Serve with lime wedges on the side for a bright, tangy finish.

### Notes
- Adjust chili powder and jalapeños to your preferred spice level.
- For extra texture, reserve a small amount of kale to stir in at the end for a slightly crunchy bite.
