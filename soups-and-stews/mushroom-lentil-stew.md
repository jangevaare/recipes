# Mushroom Lentil Stew

## Ingredients

- **Vegetables and Aromatics:**
  - 2 tablespoons olive oil
  - 2 yellow onions, thinly sliced
  - 2 stalks celery, chopped
  - 1 fennel bulb, chopped
  - 4 cloves garlic, finely chopped
  - 1 pound cremini mushrooms roughly chopped

- **Herbs and Spices:**
  - 2 tablespoons fresh sage, minced (or 2 teaspoons dried)
  - 1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes (adjust to taste)
  - 1 teaspoon ground anise seeds (or ground fennel seeds)
  - 1/2 teaspoon black pepper
  - 1/2 teaspoon smoked paprika
  - 1 teaspoon dried oregano
  - 1 teaspoon sea salt (adjust to taste)

- **Legumes and Broth:**
  - 1/2 cup dried brown lentils
  - 4–6 cups vegetable broth

## Instructions

1. **Caramelize Onions:**
   - In a large pot, heat olive oil over medium heat. Add thinly sliced onions and sauté for about 20 minutes until they are caramelized and lightly browned.

2. **Add Vegetables and Spices:**
   - While onions are cooking, chop celery, fennel, garlic, and mushrooms.
   - Once onions are ready, add chopped vegetables to the pot along with sage, red pepper flakes, ground anise, black pepper, smoked paprika, oregano, and salt.
   - Sauté for another 15 minutes, stirring frequently, until vegetables soften and mushrooms release their moisture.

3. **Simmer Soup:**
   - Add dried lentils and 4 cups of vegetable broth to the pot. Bring to a simmer, cover partially (lid vented), and cook for 30 minutes until lentils are tender.
   - If a thinner consistency is desired, add additional broth as needed.

4. **Adjust Seasoning and Serve:**
   - Taste the soup and adjust seasoning as necessary.
   - Serve hot, optionally garnished with fresh herbs or a drizzle of olive oil.
