## Instructions
1. **Prep (before heat):** Dice sweet potato, celery, carrot, and chosen allium; destem and tear tuscan kale; mince garlic.
2. Heat a wide pot or Dutch oven over medium with a generous glug of olive oil. Add sweet potato, celery, carrot, and allium with a pinch of salt. Cook until softened and glossy with no browning; sizzle should quiet as moisture cooks off.
3. Add garlic and smoked paprika; cook 1–2 minutes until fragrant and the paprika blooms.
4. Add stock and bring to a gentle simmer; cook 2–3 minutes until vegetables are fully tender.
5. Spoon out ~2 cups of vegetables and liquid; blend smooth and return to the pot.
6. Add beans and tuscan kale. Simmer 5–7 minutes until greens are tender and the stew looks creamy and cohesive.
7. Lower heat and stir in Asiago until melted and glossy. Season with salt if needed and plenty of black pepper.
8. **To serve:** Ladle into warm bowls; finish with olive oil and black pepper. Bread for mopping is essential.
9. **Storage/freezing:** Refrigerate up to 4 days. Reheat gently with a splash of water or stock. Freeze without cheese; add Asiago after reheating.
