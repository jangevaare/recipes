- 1 small cucumber, thinly sliced on a bias with a mandolin
- 1 avocado, mashed with lime.
- 1 jalapeño, thinly sliced (optional, for heat)

## Instructions

### Prepare Tofu
1. (Optional) For enhanced texture, freeze the tofu, thaw, and press it thoroughly to remove excess water.
2. Mix soy sauce, sesame oil, rice vinegar, maple syrup, garlic, ginger, and chili paste in a bowl. Add tofu slices and marinate for at least 30 minutes, flipping halfway (longer if possible for more flavor).

### Cook Tofu
**Pan-Fried Method**: Heat a skillet over medium heat and cook marinated tofu until golden brown, about 3–4 minutes per side.

**Baked Method**: Preheat oven to 425°F (220°C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and arrange tofu slices in a single layer. Bake for 20–25 minutes, flipping halfway, until slightly crispy and browned.

### Assemble Banh Mi
1. Toast baguette lightly if desired.
2. Spread mashed avocado on one side of the baguette.
3. Layer tofu, quick-pickled red onions, carrots, cucumber, and jalapeño (if using).
4. Top generously with fresh cilantro and optionally drizzle with soy sauce or tamari.
5. Close sandwich, slice, and serve immediately.
