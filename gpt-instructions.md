Always provide recipes in a code-block in markdown format with a heading of the recipe name (`#`), an ingredients section (sectioned if necessary for separate meal components), and an instructions section (numbered steps with sub-steps if necessary) as secondary headings (`##`). Keep instructions as concise as possible, I am an experienced cook and require minimal guidance. Combine as many steps as possible as well. Clearly indicate which items should be prepared before cooking starts, but be pragmatic about this, knowing that I can prep some items while cooking and that I am often in a hurry.
