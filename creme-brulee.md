# Crème Brûlée

## Ingredients
- 5 large egg yolks
- 90g sugar
- 476g heavy cream or whipping cream (2 cups)
- 1g salt
- 1 vanilla bean, split (or vanilla extract if preferred)

## Instructions
### Prep
1. Preheat oven to 325°F (160°C).
2. Split and scrape the vanilla bean (if using).

### Custard
1. In a saucepan, combine cream, vanilla bean, and salt. Cook over low heat, stirring frequently, until the mixture reaches 55–60°C (131–140°F). Remove from heat and let sit for a few minutes. Discard vanilla bean or, if using extract, add it now.
2. In a bowl, beat egg yolks and sugar until light. Stir about a quarter of the warm cream mixture into the yolk mixture to temper. Pour the tempered yolk mixture back into the saucepan with the cream and stir to combine.

### Baking
1. Divide custard evenly into four 6oz ramekins. Place ramekins in a baking dish and fill the dish with boiling water halfway up the sides of the ramekins.
2. Bake for 30–40 minutes, or until centers are barely set. Remove ramekins from the water bath, cool completely, and refrigerate for several hours or up to two days.

### Caramelizing
1. When ready to serve, sprinkle 2 tsp of sugar evenly over the top of each custard. Using a torch, heat the sugar until it melts and browns or slightly blackens.
2. Serve immediately, within two hours for best results.
