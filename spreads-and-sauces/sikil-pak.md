- 4 medium tomatillos (~220 g), husked
- 80 g white onion (about ½ medium), finely minced
- 2 garlic cloves, minced
- 80 g cotija cheese, finely crumbled (plus extra for garnish)
- 3 Tbsp fresh lime juice (plus more to adjust)
- 4 Tbsp neutral oil (grapeseed or sunflower)
- Salt, to taste

### Quick-Pickled Jalapeño
- 1 medium jalapeño (~25 g), very finely diced
- 2 Tbsp white vinegar
- 2 Tbsp water
- ½ tsp sugar
- ½ tsp salt

### To Serve
- Belgian endive leaves *or*
- Crisp tostadas / toasted tortillas

## Instructions

1. **Prep (before heat):**  
   Rinse pepitas and dry thoroughly. Dice jalapeño finely. Husk tomatillos.
2. **Quick-pickle the jalapeño:**  
   Combine jalapeño, vinegar, water, sugar, and salt. Stir and let stand 15–20 minutes. Drain well before using.
3. **Broil poblanos + tomatillos:**  
   Place poblanos and tomatillos on a foil-lined tray under a high broiler (~10 cm from heat).  
   - Poblanos: Broil, turning, until skins are deeply blistered and blackened all over.  
   - Tomatillos: Broil until collapsed with charred spots and juices bubbling.  
   Steam poblanos covered 5 minutes, peel and seed. Finely chop poblanos and tomatillos together.
4. **Toast pepitas:**  
   In a dry skillet over medium heat, toast pepitas until lightly golden and aromatic, with occasional popping. Do not brown deeply. Cool slightly.
5. **Coarse grind:**  
   Pulse pepitas to a **coarse sand with small chunks**. Avoid flour.
6. **Assemble:**  
   In a bowl, combine ground pepitas, chopped poblanos/tomatillos, onion, garlic, drained pickled jalapeño, cotija, oil, and lime juice. Fold gently to preserve texture.
7. **Season:**  
   Add salt to taste. Adjust lime for brightness. The dip should be thick, rustic, smoky, and tangy—not creamy.
8. **To serve:**  
   Spoon into a shallow bowl. Garnish lightly with extra cotija. Serve with endive leaves or crisp tostadas.
9. **Storage:**  
   Best same day. Holds refrigerated 24 hours; bring to room temperature and re-acidify with lime before serving.
