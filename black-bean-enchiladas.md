## Ingredients

**For the Enchilada Sauce:**
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
- 2 tablespoons chili powder
- 1 teaspoon ground cumin
- 2 cloves fresh garlic, minced
- 1/4 teaspoon dried oregano
- 2 cups vegetable broth
- 1 teaspoon apple cider vinegar
- Salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste

**For the Enchiladas:**
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 1 medium red onion, chopped
- 1 red bell pepper, chopped
- 1 small head of broccoli, florets chopped into small pieces
- 5 ounces baby spinach (about 5 cups)
- 1 teaspoon ground cumin
- 1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
- 1 can (15 ounces) black beans, drained and rinsed
- 1 cup shredded cheddar cheese, divided
- 8 whole wheat tortillas (8 inches in diameter)
- Fresh cilantro, chopped, for garnish

## Instructions

1. **Prepare the Enchilada Sauce:**
   - In a medium saucepan over medium heat, warm the olive oil until shimmering.
   - Add the flour, chili powder, cumin, minced garlic, and oregano. Cook, whisking constantly, until fragrant and slightly deepened in color, about 1 minute.
   - Gradually whisk in the vegetable broth, ensuring no lumps remain. Bring to a simmer and cook, whisking often, until the sauce has thickened, about 5 to 7 minutes.
   - Remove from heat, stir in the apple cider vinegar, and season with salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste. Set aside.

2. **Prepare the Filling:**
   - Preheat the oven to 400°F (200°C). Lightly grease a 9x13-inch baking dish.
   - In a large skillet over medium heat, warm the olive oil. Add the red onion and a pinch of salt. Cook, stirring often, until the onion is tender and translucent, about 5 minutes.
   - Add the bell pepper and broccoli. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the vegetables are tender, about 8 minutes.
   - Add the ground cumin and cinnamon. Cook, stirring constantly, until fragrant, about 30 seconds.
   - Add the spinach in batches, stirring until wilted after each addition.
   - Remove the skillet from heat. Stir in the black beans, 1/4 cup of the shredded cheese, and 2 tablespoons of the enchilada sauce. Season with salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste.

3. **Assemble the Enchiladas:**
   - Spread 1/2 cup of the enchilada sauce evenly over the bottom of the prepared baking dish.
   - Place about 1/2 cup of the filling down the center of each tortilla. Roll up the tortillas snugly and place them seam-side down in the baking dish.
   - Pour the remaining enchilada sauce evenly over the enchiladas. Sprinkle with the remaining 3/4 cup of shredded cheese.

4. **Bake:**
   - Bake in the preheated oven until the sauce is bubbly and the cheese is melted and golden, about 20 minutes.
   - Remove from the oven and let the enchiladas rest for 10 minutes before serving.
   - Garnish with chopped fresh cilantro and serve.
