**Prep Time:** 15 minutes  
**Total Time:** 15 minutes  

## Ingredients

- 1/2 cup fresh mint leaves (packed)  
- 1 small green chili (adjust to taste)  
- 1-inch piece of ginger

## Instructions

1. **Blanch the Herbs**
   - Bring a small pot of water to a boil.  
   - Add mint leaves to the boiling water for **5–10 seconds**.  
   - Immediately transfer the leaves to an ice water bath. Drain and pat dry with a clean towel.

2. **Prepare the Lime Flesh**
   - Peel the lime and separate the flesh from the membrane. Remove any seeds. This will act as a source of both citrus and texture.

3. **Blend the Chutney**
   - In a blender, combine blanched cilantro and mint, lime flesh, green chili, ginger, sugar, and salt.  
   - Add the oil for emulsification and blend until smooth, adding water gradually to reach the desired consistency.
