- ½ small red onion, roughly chopped  
- 2 cloves garlic, minced  
- 2 tbsp chickpea flour (as needed)  
- 1 tsp ground cumin  
- 1 tsp ground coriander  
- ½ tsp ground cayenne pepper (optional)  
- ½ tsp baking powder

### Wrap Components

## Instructions

### Prepare the Falafel Spread  
1. **Blend the Base**: In a food processor, pulse garlic and onion until finely chopped. Add chickpeas, parsley, cilantro, cumin, coriander, cayenne, baking powder, salt, and black pepper. Pulse until a coarse paste forms.  
2. **Adjust Consistency**: Mix in chickpea flour and lemon juice, pulsing until the mixture is spreadable but not too wet.  

### Cook the Falafel Wrap  
3. **Spread & Cook**: Evenly spread a thin layer of falafel mixture over one side of a tortilla or pita. Heat a non-stick frying pan over medium heat with a little olive oil. Place the wrap falafel-side down and cook for about 4 minutes until golden and crisp.

### Assemble the Wrap  
4. **Add Fresh Ingredients**: Remove from heat and add selected spread/sauce. Layer spinach, vegetables, feta, and fresh cilantro.  
5. **Wrap & Serve**: Roll the tortilla tightly or fold the pita.
