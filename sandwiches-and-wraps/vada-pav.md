## Instructions

### Prepare Vada
1. **Boil Potatoes:** Boil 4 medium potatoes until soft. Peel and set aside.
2. **Make Spice Paste:** Using a mortar and pestle, crush 1 inch ginger, 5–6 garlic cloves, and 2 green chilies into a coarse paste.
3. **Temper Spices:** Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a pan over medium heat. Add 3/4 teaspoon mustard seeds; let them splutter. Add 12–15 curry leaves and the ginger-garlic-chili paste. Sauté until raw aroma disappears (1 minute).
4. **Add Potatoes:** Add boiled potatoes to the pan. Remove from heat. Add 1/4 teaspoon turmeric powder and 3/4 teaspoon salt. Mash potatoes and mix well. Stir in 2 tablespoons chopped cilantro.
5. **Form Patties:** Once the mixture is cool enough to handle, divide it into 8 equal portions. Shape each portion into a ball and flatten slightly. Set aside.

### Prepare Batter
1. **Mix Dry Ingredients:** In a bowl, combine 1 cup besan, 1/4 teaspoon turmeric powder, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and a pinch of baking soda.
2. **Add Water:** Gradually add 1/2 cup water, whisking to form a smooth, lump-free batter. Adjust consistency with additional water if necessary; the batter should be neither too thick nor too thin.

### Fry Vada
1. **Heat Oil:** In a deep pan, heat vegetable oil over medium-high heat for frying.
2. **Coat and Fry:** Dip each potato patty into the batter, ensuring it's fully coated. Carefully drop into hot oil. Fry until golden brown and crisp. Remove and drain on paper towels.

### Assemble Vada Pav
1. **Toast Pav:** Slice each pav horizontally, keeping one side intact. Lightly butter the inner sides and toast on a skillet until slightly crisp.
2. **Apply Chutneys:** Spread green chutney on one side and tamarind chutney on the other side of the pav. Sprinkle dry garlic chutney over the chutneys.
3. **Add Vada:** Place a fried vada in the center of the pav. Serve immediately.
