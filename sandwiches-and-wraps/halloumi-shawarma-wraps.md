# Halloumi Shawarma Wraps (Crispy Baked)

## Ingredients
### Shawarma halloumi
- 300 g halloumi (about 1 large block)
- 20 ml olive oil (about 1½ Tbsp)
- 20 g Greek yoghurt (about 1 heaped Tbsp)
- **shawarma spice mix**
  - 2 tsp ground cumin
  - 2 tsp ground coriander
  - 2 tsp smoked paprika
  - 1 tsp garlic powder
  - ½ tsp cinnamon
  - ½ tsp black pepper
  - Optional: 1/4 tsp chilli flakes (heat)

### Quick sumac salad
- 100 g red onion (about 3/4 medium), thinly sliced
- 1.5 tsp sumac
- 30–45 ml lemon juice (2–3 Tbsp; about 1 lemon)
- 200 g cucumber (about ⅔ English cucumber), diced
- 150 g tomatoes (about 1 medium), diced
- 10 g parsley (about ¼ cup chopped)
- Optional: pinch of salt (go light—halloumi is salty)

### Garlic yoghurt sauce
- 90 g Greek yoghurt (about ⅓ cup)
- 1 small garlic clove, finely grated (or ½ tsp garlic powder)
- 10–15 ml lemon juice (2–3 tsp)
- Black pepper
- Optional: 1 tsp tahini (rounder, more “shawarma-shop”)

### To assemble
- 3 medium wraps or 2 large wraps
- 80–100 g baby lettuces (about 3 big handfuls)

## Instructions
1. **Prep (before heat):** Line a tray with parchment. Thin-slice onion; toss with sumac + lemon (and optional pinch salt). Leave to soften 10 min.
2. Heat oven to **220°C** (or **200°C convection**). Pat halloumi very dry. Peel into ribbons with a Y-peeler (best texture) or slice into thin batons.
3. Toss halloumi gently with yoghurt + olive oil, then sprinkle over the DIY spice mix and toss again until evenly coated.
4. Spread halloumi in a single layer (no crowding). Bake until edges are **golden with browned spots** and the coating looks **set/drier** (about 10–14 min). Optional: broil/grill 1–2 min to deepen browning. Rest 2 min to firm.
5. While halloumi bakes, finish salad: add cucumber, tomatoes, parsley, and black pepper to the onion bowl; toss. Mix sauce: yoghurt + garlic + lemon + pepper (and optional tahini).
6. **To serve:** Warm wraps (dry pan until pliable with **toasty freckles**). Spread garlic yoghurt, add baby lettuces, spoon on salad, pile on halloumi. Finish with extra sumac/lemon. Optional: toast the wrapped seam-side down until **crisp**.
