## Instructions
1. **Prep tomato sauce:** Roast tomatoes and garlic at 400°F (200°C) for 25 min until blistered. Squeeze garlic from skins, blend with tomatoes, oil, vinegar, seasoning, and chili flakes until smooth.  
2. **Prep eggplant:** Salt slices, rest 20 min, pat dry. Dredge in flour, dip in egg, coat with breadcrumbs mixed with Parmesan.  
3. **Cook eggplant:** Fry in olive oil until golden (or bake at 425°F/220°C for 20 min, flipping once). Drain on paper towels.
