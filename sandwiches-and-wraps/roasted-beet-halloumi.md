# Crispy Halloumi & Roasted Beet Sandwich  
### with Pesto, Hot Honey, Micro Arugula & Micro-planed Red Onion

## Ingredients (4 sandwiches)

### Prep-ahead
- 2 medium red beets, peeled, 1 cm slices
- 2 Tbsp olive oil, salt & pepper

### Halloumi
- 450 g halloumi, 1 cm slabs
- ½ cup (65 g) flour, seasoned with salt/pepper
- 1 large egg, beaten with a splash of water
- 1 cup (60 g) panko

### Assembly
- 4 crusty rolls (ciabatta or sourdough)
- ½ cup pesto (store-bought or fresh)
- ¼ cup hot honey (or honey + chili flakes)
- 1 small red onion, micro-planed or grated
- 1 lightly packed cup micro arugula
- Olive oil, for shallow-fry

## Instructions

1. **Roast beets (do ahead / first):** Toss slices with olive oil, salt & pepper; roast 400 °F / 200 °C until tender & edges caramelize, ~25 min, flipping once. Cool slightly.  
2. **Bread halloumi:** Pat dry; dredge in seasoned flour → egg → panko. Press well.  
3. **Fry:** Shallow-fry halloumi in ½ cm olive oil over medium-high until deep golden, ~1½ min/side. Drain on rack. (Toast rolls in oven during this.)  
4. **Assemble:** Slather roll bases with pesto, layer roasted beet, crispy halloumi, generous drizzle of hot honey, quick shower of micro-planed onion, and a tuft of micro arugula. Crown with top bun spread with a little extra pesto.  
5. **Serve immediately** while halloumi is still molten-inside crispy-outside.
