# Zucchini and Red Pepper Quesadillas

## Ingredients
- 8 large flour tortillas
- 2 red bell peppers, thinly sliced
- 2 medium zucchinis, thinly sliced
- 4 cups fresh spinach, roughly chopped
- 340 g mozzarella cheese
- 1 can (15 oz / 425 g) black beans, drained and rinsed
- 4 cloves garlic, minced
- 1½ tsp smoked paprika
- 1½ tsp ground cumin
- ½ tsp chili flakes (or more to taste)
- ½ tsp dried oregano
- Salt and freshly ground black pepper, generously to taste
- Olive oil, as needed

## Instructions
### Prep before cooking:
- Slice bell peppers and zucchinis; mince garlic; roughly chop spinach; shred mozzarella; rinse and drain black beans.

### Cooking:
1. Heat olive oil in large skillet over medium-high heat; sauté peppers and zucchini until lightly browned (4–5 min). Add garlic, smoked paprika, cumin, chili flakes, oregano, salt, and pepper; sauté 1 min more.
2. Add spinach and black beans, stir briefly until spinach wilts and beans are warmed through (1–2 min); remove from heat.
3. Assemble quesadillas: layer veggie-bean mixture and mozzarella evenly on one half of each tortilla, then fold over.
4. Cook quesadillas in lightly oiled skillet over medium heat until golden brown, crispy, and cheese melts (2–3 min per side).
