# Oatmeal Chocolate Chip Cookies

## Ingredients
- 275 g butter, browned
- 200 g light brown sugar
- 100 g white sugar
- 2 eggs
- 8 g vanilla extract
- 180 g all-purpose flour
- 3 g baking soda
- 5 g salt
- 280 g quick-cooking oats
- 150 g chopped walnuts
- 250 g semisweet chocolate chips

## Instructions
1. **Prep Work**:  
   - Preheat oven to 350°F (175°C).  
   - Line baking sheets with parchment paper (optional but recommended).  

2. **Make the Dough**:  
   - In a large bowl, cream together the browned butter, brown sugar, and white sugar until smooth.  
   - Beat in eggs one at a time, then stir in vanilla extract.  
   - In a separate bowl, whisk together flour, baking soda, and salt. Gradually stir this into the creamed mixture until just blended.  
   - Fold in the oats, walnuts, and chocolate chips.

3. **Shape and Bake**:  
   - Drop heaping spoonfuls of dough onto prepared baking sheets.  
   - Bake for 12 minutes (raw dough) or 14 minutes (frozen dough) until edges are golden and centers are slightly soft.

4. **Cool and Serve**:  
   - Let cookies cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely. Enjoy fresh or store in an airtight container.

### Notes
- Browning the butter enhances the flavor with a nutty aroma. Allow it to cool slightly before creaming with sugars.  
- Chilling the dough before baking can improve texture and reduce spreading.  
- Customize with raisins or additional nuts if desired.
