# Garlic Chutney

## Ingredients
- 1 cup roasted peanuts (unsalted)
- 8â€“10 garlic cloves (peeled)
- 2 tablespoons Kashmiri chili powder
- 1 teaspoon cumin seeds
- 1/2 teaspoon sugar
- Salt to taste

## Instructions
1. **Prep the ingredients:**
   - Ensure the peanuts are roasted and cooled. If not roasted, lightly roast them in a dry pan until golden and aromatic, then let them cool completely.

2. **Toast garlic and spices:**
   - Dry roast the garlic cloves in a pan on low heat until they are golden and fragrant. Remove and set aside.
   - In the same pan, lightly toast the cumin seeds for 1 minute until aromatic. Let them cool.

3. **Grind the chutney:**
   - Add the roasted peanuts, garlic, toasted cumin, Kashmiri chili powder, sugar, and salt to a blender or food processor.
   - Pulse the mixture until you achieve a coarse, crumbly texture. Avoid over-grinding to prevent the peanuts from releasing their oil.
