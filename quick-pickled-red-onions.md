# Quick Pickled Red Onions (Cold Brine Method)

## Ingredients
- 1 large red onion, thinly sliced using a mandolin slicer
- 1/2 cup white vinegar
- 1/2 cup apple cider vinegar
- 1/2 cup cold water
- 1 tablespoon sugar
- 1 teaspoon salt

## Instructions
1. **Prepare the Onion:**
   - Use a mandolin slicer to thinly slice the red onion. Be cautious and use a guard to protect your hands.

2. **Prepare the Brine:**
   - In a small bowl, combine the sugar and salt with 1/4 cup warm water. Stir until dissolved.
   - Mix in the white vinegar, apple cider vinegar, and cold water. Add optional spices if desired.

3. **Pickle the Onions:**
   - Place the sliced onions in a clean, heat-safe jar (e.g., a mason jar).
   - Pour the cold brine over the onions, ensuring they are fully submerged. Use a spoon to gently press them down if needed.

4. **Refrigerate:**
   - Seal the jar with a lid and refrigerate. The pickled onions will take about 12 hours to develop their full flavor, though they can be eaten after 1-2 hours.

## Storage
- Store in the refrigerator for up to **2 weeks**. Make sure the onions remain submerged in the brine to keep them fresh.
