### Mashed Potato Topping  
- 2 lb (907 g) russet or Yukon gold potatoes, peeled & cut into 1-inch chunks  
- 3 Tbsp (43 g) unsalted butter, softened  
- ¼ cup (60 g) sour cream **or** plain Greek yogurt **or** whole milk/cream  
- ½ tsp salt  
- ¾ cup (85 g) shredded sharp white cheddar (optional)

## Instructions
1. **Prep (before heat):** Peel & chop potatoes; mince garlic; dice onions, carrots, celery; drain & rinse beans.  
2. **Start potatoes & filling:** In a large pot, cover potatoes with cold water and bring to a boil; reduce to simmer until fork-tender (≈10–15 min). Meanwhile, heat olive oil in a large oven-safe skillet over medium heat. Add onion, carrots, celery, and mushrooms; cook until softened ≈5 min. Stir in garlic and cook 1 min.  
3. **Build filling:** Add red wine and vinegar; scrape browned bits and reduce most liquid ≈4 min. Stir in tomato paste, broth, beans, herbs, salt, pepper, and bay leaf; bring to boil, then reduce heat and simmer until sauce thickens ≈20 min. Discard bay leaf, then stir in frozen mixed vegetables.  
4. **Finish topping:** Drain potatoes and return to pot. Add butter, sour cream (or substitute), and salt; mash until smooth. Fold in cheddar, if using. Spread potatoes evenly over filling.  
5. **Bake & brown:** Bake in preheated 350 °F (177 °C) oven 30 min. Switch to broiler and broil 1–3 min until golden-brown spots appear.  
6. **Serve:** Let rest 5 min, sprinkle with parsley, and serve with a simple green salad or steamed greens.

## Storage/Freezing
- **Refrigerate:** Store airtight up to 5 days; reheat in oven or microwave.  
- **Freeze:** Assemble unbaked; freeze up to 3 months. Thaw in fridge and bake until hot, then broil to brown the top.
