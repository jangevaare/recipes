## Instructions

1. **Prep (before heat):**  
   Cube butter; peel and dice sweet potatoes and squash; drain chickpeas; grate garlic and ginger; measure spices; chop kale and cilantro.

2. **Make crust:**  
   a. Mix flour, salt, and sugar. Cut in butter loosely, leaving large visible pieces.  
   b. Add ice water just until dough holds together.  
   c. Divide into 4 portions (~670 g). Roll each into a rectangle, fold into thirds, chill 20 min; repeat roll + fold **3 times total**.  
   d. Rest 45–60 min before rolling.

3. **Roast vegetables:**  
   Toss sweet potatoes and squash with oil and salt. Roast at **220 °C / 425 °F** until fork-tender with browned edges and surfaces look dry rather than steamy. Cool completely.

4. **Build tikka–masala base:**  
   Heat oil in a large wide pot over medium-low. Add garlic and ginger; cook until fragrant and raw bite is gone, no browning. Add tomato paste and cook until brick-red, thick, and oil begins to separate. Lower heat; add all spices and stir constantly 45–60 seconds until deeply aromatic. Stir in salt and acid; cook 1 minute.

5. **Simmer sauce:**  
   Add canned tomatoes and coconut milk. Simmer 15–20 minutes until glossy, thick, and spoon-coating; bubbling should be slow and heavy.

6. **Finish filling:**  
   Fold in roasted vegetables and chickpeas. Add kale and cook just until wilted and bright. Adjust salt; add lime zest and juice. Fold in cilantro. Cool completely. Texture should be chunky, cohesive, with no free liquid.

7. **Assemble pies:**  
   Roll crusts to 3–4 mm. Line 9-inch pie dishes, fill generously (≈ 1.35–1.45 kg each), top crust, seal, crimp, vent, and egg wash.

8. **Bake (fresh):**  
   Bake at **200 °C / 400 °F** for 20 min, then reduce to **180 °C / 350 °F** and bake 35–45 min until deep golden and filling bubbles through vents. Rest 20–30 min before slicing.

9. **From frozen (unbaked):**  
   Bake straight from freezer at **200 °C / 400 °F** for 25 min, then **175 °C / 345 °F** for 55–65 min. Tent if browning too fast. Filling must be visibly bubbling.

10. **To serve:**  
    Slice with a sharp knife once just warm. Finish with a squeeze of lime or a spoon of yogurt if desired; skip if rushed.

11. **Storage/freezing:**  
    Freeze fully assembled, unbaked pies. Wrap once solid. Best within 6–8 weeks. Reheat leftovers in a low oven to keep crust crisp.
