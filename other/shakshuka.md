# Shakshuka With Feta and Chickpeas

## Ingredients
### Base
- 3 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil
- 1 large red onion, halved and thinly sliced
- 1 large red bell pepper, seeded and thinly sliced
- 2 garlic cloves, thinly sliced
- 1 tsp ground cumin
- 1 tsp sweet paprika
- 1 tsp smoked paprika
- ⅛ tsp ground cayenne (adjust to taste)

### Sauce
- 1 (28-ounce) can whole plum tomatoes, coarsely chopped with juices
- 1 (15-ounce) can chickpeas, drained and rinsed
- ¾ tsp kosher salt (plus more to taste)
- ¼ tsp black pepper (plus more to taste)

### Toppings
- 5 oz feta, crumbled (about 1¼ cups)
- 6 large eggs
- Chopped cilantro, for garnish
- Optional: Hot sauce, for serving

## Instructions
### Preparation
1. Preheat oven to 375°F (190°C).

### Cooking
2. Heat olive oil in a large, oven-safe skillet over medium-low heat. Add sliced onion and bell pepper. Cook gently, stirring occasionally, until very soft, about 20 minutes.
3. Add garlic and sauté for 1-2 minutes until fragrant. Stir in cumin, sweet paprika, smoked paprika, and cayenne; cook for 1 minute to toast the spices.
4. Add the chopped tomatoes with their juices and chickpeas. Season with ¾ tsp salt and ¼ tsp black pepper. Simmer over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until the sauce thickens, about 10 minutes. Taste and adjust seasoning as needed.
5. Stir in crumbled feta evenly throughout the sauce.

### Baking
6. Using a spoon, make small wells in the sauce and gently crack the eggs into the wells. Season the eggs with salt and pepper.
7. Transfer the skillet to the oven and bake until the egg whites are just set but yolks are still runny, about 7-10 minutes.

### Serving
8. Remove from the oven and sprinkle with chopped cilantro. Serve immediately with hot sauce on the side if desired.
