# Grape Tomato Tartare  

## Ingredients  
### Marinated Tomatoes  
- **1 ¾ lb / 800 g grape tomatoes**, quartered lengthwise  
- ¼ cup white balsamic vinegar  
- 2 small shallots, minced (≈ 3 Tbsp)  
- 3 Tbsp chopped fresh cilantro (or flat-leaf parsley)  
- Large pinch sea salt + freshly-ground pepper  

### Slow-Roasted Tomatoes (for depth)  
- 8 oz / 225 g grape tomatoes, left whole  
- 2 Tbsp extra-virgin olive oil  
- 2 tsp fresh thyme leaves  

### Herb oil
- 1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil
- Fresh herbs such as basil, parsley and chives

### Finishing & Plating  
- ½ cup good balsamic vinegar (for reduction)  
- 3 Tbsp herb oil*    
- 4 oz soft plant-based mozzarella **or** burrata, torn  
- 8 small basil leaves

## Instructions  
1. Make herb oil by whizzing 1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil with a handful of basil, parsley & chives (or other herbs) and straining
2. **Start the reduction (can run unattended).** Simmer balsamic vinegar in a small pan over medium-low heat until syrupy and coats a spoon, 12-15 min; cool.
3. **Marinate fresh tomatoes.** Combine quartered grape tomatoes with white balsamic, minced shallots, cilantro, salt & pepper in a bowl; toss and set aside (room temp) while you roast.  
4. **Roast depth boosters.**  
   - Preheat oven to **250 °F / 120 °C**.  
   - Roll whole grape tomatoes with olive oil & thyme on a parchment-lined tray.  
   - Slow-roast 40-45 min until collapsed yet still juicy; cool, then finely dice.  
5. **Combine textures.** Drain excess liquid from the marinated tomatoes (keep a splash for flavour), fold in the diced roasted tomatoes. Taste → adjust salt/acid.  
6. **Plate fast.** Pack ½-cup portions of tartare into a ring mold (or teacup) on chilled plates. Lift mold, drizzle with balsamic reduction & herb oil.  
7. **Garnish & serve.** Top each mound with torn mozzarella/burrata and a basil leaf. Spoon extra dressing around the plate and serve immediately with crostini or endive spears.
