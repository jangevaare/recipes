- 1 teaspoon ground cumin
- 1/2 teaspoon chili powder
- 1/4 teaspoon smoked paprika
- 1 (15-ounce) can black beans, rinsed and drained

## Instructions
1. **Prepare the chili**:
   - Soak the dried chili in warm water for about 10 minutes to rehydrate.
   - Remove the stem and seeds.

2. **Process the sauce base**:
   - In a food processor, combine the garlic, tomato paste, rehydrated chili, and 1/4 cup water or vegetable broth.
   - Blend until smooth.

3. **Sauté the onion**:
   - Heat the olive oil in a skillet over medium heat.
   - Add the diced onion and sauté for 3–4 minutes, until softened.

4. **Add sauce and spices**:
   - Pour the processed mixture into the skillet with the onions.
   - Stir in the cumin, chili powder, and smoked paprika.
   - Cook for 2–3 minutes, stirring frequently, to allow the flavors to meld.

5. **Incorporate the beans**:
   - Add the black beans to the skillet and stir to coat them in the sauce.
   - Lower the heat and simmer for 5–7 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the sauce thickens and clings to the beans.

6. **Adjust seasoning**:
   - Add salt and black pepper to taste.
