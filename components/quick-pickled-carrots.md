# Quick-Pickled Carrots with Ginger

## Ingredients
- 1–2 large carrots, mandolin-sliced into matchsticks  
- 1-inch piece fresh ginger, peeled and thinly sliced  
- ½ cup rice wine vinegar (or apple cider vinegar)  
- ¼ cup water  
- 1 tbsp sugar  
- ½ tsp salt  
- 1 tbsp lemon or lime juice (optional)  

## Instructions
1. **Prepare the carrots**: Use a mandolin to slice the carrots into matchsticks. Thinly slice the ginger.  
2. **Make the brine**: In a small saucepan, heat the vinegar, water, sugar, and salt over medium heat until dissolved. Remove from heat and stir in lemon or lime juice, if using.  
3. **Pickle the carrots**: Pack the carrots and ginger into a heatproof jar, then pour the hot brine over them. Press down to ensure they are submerged.  
4. **Cool & store**: Let sit at room temperature for 30 minutes, then refrigerate. They're best after a few hours but can be eaten sooner. Store in the fridge for up to a week.
