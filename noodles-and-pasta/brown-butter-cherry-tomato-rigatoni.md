# Brown Butter & Thyme Cherry Tomato Pasta with Crispy Garlic Pangrattato

## Ingredients

### Garlic-Infused Oil
- 5 tbsp olive or avocado oil  
- 4 cloves garlic, thinly sliced  

### Tomato Sauce
- Remaining garlic-infused oil (after pangrattato)
- 1 ½ pints (12–15 oz) grape tomatoes, quartered  
- Pinch of salt  
- 2 tsp regular tomato paste  
- 2 tsp red pepper flakes  
- ½ tsp red wine vinegar  
- 5 tbsp salted butter  
- 2 sprigs fresh thyme  
- Zest of 1 lemon  

### Garlic Pangrattato
- 2 tbsp garlic-infused oil (reserved from above)  
- ⅓ cup panko breadcrumbs  
- Pinch of salt  
- Pinch of black pepper or lemon zest (optional, for brightness)  

### Rest
- ½ lb rigatoni  
- Asiago cheese, for garnish  
- Fresh cracked black pepper  
- Olive oil, for finishing  

## Instructions

### 1. Garlic & Pangrattato  
- In a small frying pan, heat 5 tbsp oil over medium. Add sliced garlic and cook until pale golden. Remove garlic immediately and set aside (they’ll finish crisping off-heat).  
- Spoon out 2 tbsp of this garlic oil into a small bowl. Return it to the same pan, add panko + salt, and toast until golden. Stir in a pinch of pepper or lemon zest if desired. Remove and set aside.  

### 2. Tomato Base  
- While making pangrattato, bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.  
- In a large frying pan, heat remaining garlic oil. Add tomatoes + pinch of salt. Cook undisturbed 3–5 min, then stir occasionally until tomatoes collapse and juices reduce to a saucy consistency.  

### 3. Browned Butter  
- In the same small pan (wiped out if needed), melt 5 tbsp butter over medium-high. Cook until foamy and flecked with brown bits, 3–5 min.  
- Remove from heat, add thyme sprigs until sizzling subsides (~30 sec), then discard. Stir in lemon zest.  

### 4. Sauce & Pasta  
- To tomatoes, add tomato paste + red pepper flakes. Cook at least 5 min, stirring occasionally.  
- Cook rigatoni to al dente, reserving 1 cup pasta water.  
- Stir browned butter + vinegar into tomato mixture. Taste and adjust seasoning.  

### 5. Finish & Serve  
- Add pasta to sauce with ¼ cup pasta water. Stir vigorously to emulsify, adding more water until sauce is glossy and clings (up to 1 cup).  
- Finish with cracked pepper and a drizzle of olive oil.  
- Serve topped with pangrattato + crispy garlic. Garnish with Asiago.
