- 1 cup panko
- ¼ tsp kosher salt

### Sauce
- Remaining garlic-infused oil from the skillet (about 7 tbsp)
- 3 pints (24–30 oz) cherry or grape tomatoes, **halved**
- 4 tsp tomato paste
- 1–1½ tsp red pepper flakes (to taste)
- 1 tsp red wine vinegar
- 10 tbsp unsalted butter (about 140 g; 1¼ sticks)
- 4 fresh thyme sprigs
- Zest of 2 lemons
- 1½ tsp kosher salt, divided (about ¾ tsp into brown butter + ¾ tsp into tomatoes)
- 1 tsp freshly ground black pepper, plus more to finish

### Pasta
- 1 lb rigatoni
- Pecorino Romano, for serving (optional)

## Prep (before you start cooking)
- Halve tomatoes; slice garlic.  
- Bring a large pot of well-salted water to a boil.  
- Set a heatproof cup or ladle for reserving pasta water.

## Instructions

1) **Garlic chips + infused oil**  
   Add **all** the oil and sliced garlic to a large stainless/nonstick skillet. Set over medium and cook, stirring, until just golden. Lift out garlic chips; reserve. Pour **⅓ cup** hot garlic oil into a small skillet for pangrattato; leave the **remaining oil (~7 tbsp)** in the large skillet for the sauce.

2) **Toast pangrattato**  
   Heat the small skillet over medium. Add panko and ¼ tsp salt; stir until deep golden. Transfer to a bowl.

3) **Tomatoes + pasta**  
   Large skillet back on medium-high. Add halved tomatoes and **~¾ tsp salt**; cook 3–5 min undisturbed until some blister and juices pool, then stir and reduce to medium. Drop rigatoni into boiling water; cook to al dente, reserving up to **2 cups** pasta water.

4) **Brown the butter**  
   In a separate small skillet, cook butter over medium, swirling, until nutty brown bits form, 3–5 min. Off heat, add thyme to sizzle ~30 sec; discard sprigs. Stir in lemon zest and **~¾ tsp salt**.

5) **Build the sauce**  
   To tomatoes, add tomato paste and red pepper flakes; cook 1–2 min. Stir in browned butter and red wine vinegar; keep at a gentle simmer.

6) **Emulsify and finish**  
   Transfer rigatoni to the sauce with **¾ cup** pasta water. Toss hard until glossy and clinging, adding more water as needed (up to ~2 cups total). Season with **~1 tsp black pepper** and additional salt to taste.

7) **Serve**  
   Plate. Top with pangrattato and the reserved garlic chips. Finish with more black pepper and pecorino if using.
