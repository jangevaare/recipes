## Ingredients

### Roasted Butternut Squash
- 1 medium-large butternut squash, peeled, seeded, cubed (1 cm)
- 2 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil (evoo)
- Salt and freshly ground pepper
- 1 tbsp fresh sage leaves, finely chopped
- Zest of 1 lemon

### Risotto
- 2 cups arborio rice
- 6–7 cups vegetable broth, warmed
- 2 medium onions, finely diced
- ½ cup dry white wine (optional)
- 3 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil (evoo)
- ¾ cup grated Asiago cheese, plus extra for serving
- Juice of half a lemon, plus additional zest
- 2 cups fresh baby spinach
- Salt and freshly ground pepper, to taste
- Pepitas or toasted pine nuts (optional topping)
- Additional fresh sage leaves, fried crisp (optional garnish)

## Instructions

### Prep Before Cooking:
- Preheat oven to 425°F (220°C); peel, seed, and cube butternut squash; chop onions and sage; grate Asiago; warm vegetable broth.

### Roasted Butternut Squash:
1. Toss squash cubes with evoo, salt, pepper, and chopped sage; roast on baking tray ~25–30 min until crispy, turning once. Sprinkle with lemon zest when done; set aside.

### Risotto:
1. Meanwhile, heat evoo in large pot over medium heat. Sauté onions until soft and lightly caramelized (~5–6 min). Add arborio rice, toast ~1 min until grains are lightly coated.
2. Deglaze with wine (if using), then add warm broth incrementally (~1 cup at a time), stirring frequently and allowing each addition to absorb, until rice is creamy and al dente (~20–25 min total).
3. Stir in baby spinach until wilted, then add Asiago cheese, lemon juice, and extra zest. Season to taste.

### Serve:
- Top risotto generously with roasted squash cubes, optional toasted pepitas or pine nuts, additional Asiago, and fried sage leaves if desired. Finish with a squeeze of lemon juice.
