# Lentil Bolognese

## Ingredients
### Base
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 1 large onion, diced
- 1 1/2 cups carrots, diced
- 1 1/2 cups celery, diced
- 4–6 cloves garlic, roughly chopped

### Seasoning
- 1 1/2 teaspoons salt (adjust to taste)
- 1/2 teaspoon black pepper
- 1/4 teaspoon chili flakes (optional)
- 1 tablespoon fresh oregano or thyme (or 2 teaspoons dried Italian herbs)

### Sauce
- 1/3 cup tomato paste
- 1/4 cup red wine (optional)
- 3 medium tomatoes, diced with juices (or 14 oz canned diced/crushed tomatoes)
- 3 1/2 cups vegetable stock or broth

### Protein
- 1 1/4 cups beluga lentils (or other small lentils)
- 3/4 cup hemp seeds

## Instructions

### Preparation
1. Dice vegetables and chop garlic before starting.
2. Have all ingredients measured and ready to streamline cooking.

### Cooking
1. Heat olive oil in a large pot or Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Add the onion and sauté for 2–3 minutes until fragrant. Lower heat to medium, then add carrots, celery, garlic, salt, pepper, chili flakes, and herbs. Cook for 7–8 minutes, stirring occasionally.
2. Stir in the tomato paste, allowing it to brown slightly for deeper flavor. Deglaze the pot with red wine (if using), scraping up any browned bits. Once most of the wine has evaporated, add the tomatoes and their juices. Cook for 2–3 minutes to soften the tomatoes.
3. Add beluga lentils, vegetable stock, and hemp seeds or walnuts. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer gently for 20–25 minutes, or until lentils are tender.
4. Remove the lid and continue cooking uncovered until most of the liquid has evaporated and the sauce thickens. Stir in balsamic vinegar and adjust seasoning (salt, pepper, chili flakes, and vinegar) to taste.

### Serving
- Toss the sauce with your favorite pasta or serve over creamy polenta.
