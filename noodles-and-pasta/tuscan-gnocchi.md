# Tuscan Baby Gnocchi with White Wine, Lemon, and Parsley

## Ingredients (serves 4)
- 2 tbsp olive oil (use 1 tbsp from the sun-dried tomato jar if available)
- 4 oz sun-dried tomatoes, drained and chopped
- 16 oz **baby** potato gnocchi (shelf-stable or refrigerated, uncooked)
- 5 cloves garlic, minced
- 1.5 tsp dried oregano
- 1/2 tsp kosher salt, plus more to taste
- 1/4 tsp red pepper flakes, to taste
- 1/4 cup dry white wine
- 1/3 cup vegetable broth (up to 1/2 cup if needed)
- 12–14 oz baby spinach
- 7 oz canned artichoke hearts, chopped and well-drained
- Finish: 1–2 tsp lemon juice, 1/2 tsp lemon zest, 1/2 cup chopped flat-leaf parsley
- Optional: 2–3 tbsp grated Parmesan or 1–2 tbsp nutritional yeast; black pepper
- Optional texture boost: 1 tbsp butter

## Instructions
1. Large skillet medium-high. Add 1 tbsp oil and half the baby gnocchi. Sear 3–4 min, tossing, until deeply golden and crisp on several sides. Transfer to a plate. Repeat with remaining 1 tbsp oil and remaining gnocchi; reserve half the crispiest gnocchi for topping.
2. Return all but the topping gnocchi to the skillet. Add sun-dried tomatoes, garlic, oregano, and 1/2 tsp salt; cook 30–45 sec to bloom.
3. Add wine; simmer 60–90 sec to reduce by about half.
4. Add 1/3 cup broth; bring to a fast simmer; cover 2–3 min to finish cooking the baby gnocchi.
5. Uncover; add spinach and artichokes; cook 2–3 min, stirring, until spinach wilts and liquid reduces to a glossy glaze. If dry, add a splash more broth; if loose, reduce 1–2 min. Stir in butter if using.
6. Off heat: fold in lemon zest and juice, parsley, red pepper flakes, and optional Parmesan or nutritional yeast. Black pepper to taste. Adjust salt. Top with the reserved crispy gnocchi and serve.
