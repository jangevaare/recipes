# Creamy Spinach and Mushroom Orzo with White Beans

## Ingredients
- **Mushrooms:**
  - 2 tablespoons olive oil
  - 16 oz baby bella or crimini mushrooms, sliced
  - Salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste

- **Orzo:**
  - 2 cups uncooked orzo
  - 4 cups vegetable broth
  - 4 cloves garlic, minced
  - ½ teaspoon dried basil
  - ½ teaspoon dried oregano
  - ½ teaspoon dried thyme
  - ½ teaspoon dried rosemary, crushed
  - 1 teaspoon smoked paprika, plus more to taste
  - ½ teaspoon salt, plus more to taste
  - 10 oz fresh spinach
  - 1 (15 oz) can white beans (cannellini or Great Northern), drained and rinsed
  - 1 cup heavy cream
  - ½ teaspoon red pepper flakes, plus more for serving

## Instructions
1. Heat olive oil in a stock pot over medium-high heat. Cook mushrooms seasoned generously with salt and pepper until browned, about 8 minutes.
2. Add orzo, garlic, vegetable broth, herbs and spices, and salt to mushrooms. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer uncovered, stirring occasionally, about 10–12 minutes until orzo is almost tender.
3. Stir in spinach and white beans during the last 5 minutes, cooking until spinach wilts and beans are heated through. Add heavy cream, stirring gently to combine without boiling.
4. Adjust seasoning to taste with salt and smoked paprika, and mix well.
5. Serve immediately, garnished with red pepper flakes.
