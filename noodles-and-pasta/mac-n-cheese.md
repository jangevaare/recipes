# Macaroni and Cheese

## Ingredients

### Pasta
- 1 pound elbow macaroni (4 cups uncooked) or other small pasta shapes
- Generous amount of salt (for boiling water)

### Sauce
- 5 tablespoons unsalted butter
- 5 tablespoons all-purpose flour
- 2 1/2 cups milk, warmed
- 2 cups old cheddar cheese (e.g., Balderson), cubed or broken into pieces
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1/4 teaspoon mustard powder (optional)

### Flavorful Crust
- 1/2 cup panko crumbs **or** leftover sourdough pieces, broken up
- 1/4 teaspoon smoked paprika
- 1/4 teaspoon black pepper
- Pinch of salt
- 1/4 cup asiago cheese or reserved cheddar

## Instructions

### Preparation
1. Preheat the oven to 400°F.
2. Grease a cast iron skillet lightly with butter.

### Cooking
3. **Cook the Pasta:** Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Cook the pasta until al dente. Drain and set aside.

4. **Make the Roux:** In the cast iron skillet, melt the butter over medium heat. Whisk in the flour to form a smooth paste. Cook for 1–2 minutes until fragrant.

5. **Add the Milk:** Slowly whisk the warm milk into the roux in small increments. Continue whisking as the mixture transitions from clumpy to smooth. Cook for 5–8 minutes, stirring constantly, until thickened and it coats the back of a spoon.

6. **Add Cheese:** Remove the skillet from heat. Stir in the old cheddar, one handful at a time (if cubed, it will melt with patience as you stir). Mix until smooth. Add salt and mustard powder, if using.

7. **Combine with Pasta:** Add the cooked pasta directly into the skillet with the cheese sauce. Stir gently until evenly coated.

### Assemble and Bake
8. **Prepare the Crust:** In a small bowl, mix panko crumbs (or sourdough pieces), smoked paprika, black pepper, salt, and asiago cheese (or reserved cheddar). Sprinkle the mixture evenly over the top of the pasta in the skillet.

9. **Bake:** Place the skillet in the oven and bake for 10–15 minutes, until the cheese is bubbly and the crust is golden. If needed, broil for 1–2 minutes for extra crispness.

10. Serve hot and enjoy directly from the cast iron skillet!
