# Oliebollen

Makes approximately 18 oliebollen

## Ingredients

### Initial Mix
- 240 g sourdough starter (100% hydration)
- 50 g sugar
- 240 g all-purpose flour
- 160 g milk + 75 g melted butter *or* 235 g cream

### Final Batter
- 1 egg
- 1/2 tsp sea salt
- 1 1/2 tsp baking powder
- 1/2 tsp baking soda
- 1/2 tsp ground cinnamon
- 1 medium-large apple (peeled and finely chopped)
- Powdered sugar (for dusting)
- Canola oil (for frying)

## Instructions

1. **Prepare the Sponge**:  
   - In a large bowl, mix the sourdough starter, sugar, flour, milk, and butter (or cream). 
   - Cover and let rest at room temperature for 6-18 hours (overnight is ideal).

2. **Heat Oil**:  
   - Heat enough canola oil in a deep pot or fryer to fully submerge the oliebollen, maintaining a temperature of 360Â°F.

3. **Mix Final Batter**:  
   - Stir the egg, salt, baking powder, baking soda, cinnamon, and chopped apple into the rested sourdough sponge until evenly combined.

4. **Fry Oliebollen**:  
   - Dip a teaspoon into the hot oil to prevent sticking, then drop heaping teaspoons of batter into the oil.
   - Fry in batches, cooking each side for about 2 minutes or until deep golden brown, flipping halfway through.

5. **Finish and Serve**:  
   - Remove the oliebollen with a slotted spoon and drain on paper towels.
   - Dust generously with powdered sugar before serving warm.
